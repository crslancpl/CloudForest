# IDE Core
This is the application part of the ide. The UI files(including .ui and .css files) is required to run the app. If the compiled IDE cannot find UI files, the application wont run.
Download the [UI files folder](https://github.com/crslancpl/IDEUIFiles) and give the directory path of the UI files as the argument of the IDE app.
